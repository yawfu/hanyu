    "🥠 This repo is a work in progress catalog for my Mandarin learning notes.<br/>\n",
    "🥮 Currently learning on my own, but I'll probably get a tutor once I hit intermediate level.  <br/>\n",
    "🧧 I’ll document the resources I’m using (like apps, books, and other media).<br/>\n",
    "🥡 It will contain reviews of what works and what doesn’t along the way.  <br/>\n",
    "🥢 English isn’t my native language either, but I’m using English materials to practice both.<br/>\n",
    "🐼 I’m skipping Hanzi handwriting for now, at least until I’m fluent enough to bother with it.  <br/>\n",

    "| Immersi - Learn Chinese | [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.immersi.immersi&hl=pt_BR&pli=1) / [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/immersi-learn-chinese/id6501961705) | Free (Limited) | Not at the beginning (I'm still not paying) | Great tool for learning Mandarin through subtitled videos, including YouTube ones. You can watch videos by choosing a word or swapping the screen the same way you do on social media like Instagram Stories. |\n",
    "| Du Chinese | [Android app / iPhone app](https://duchinese.net/) | Free (Limited) | Not at the beginning (I'm still not paying) | Learn Mandarin by reading stories. It's graded by levels. One of the best apps for learning Mandarin out there. |\n",
    "| Pleco | [Android app / iPhone app](https://www.pleco.com/) | Free (in-app purchases) | - | No introduction needed. One of the most used apps for this purpose. A Mandarin dictionary and spaced repetition app. |\n",

    "The objective is to learn both speaking and writing (by typing), so <strike>(different from the last time)</strike>, I'll focus on learning the tones and I won't move on to the next couple of words until I learn the ones I am currently practicing in speaking and writing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that I'm learning two other languages besides Mandarin (with English being one of them), and they are *needed*, so I can't prioritize Mandarin above them. Thus, I have no rush with this _\"project\"_. I'll learn at my own pace, if not I might go crazy.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I'll use AI to get some questions answered, but I'll try not to rely on it too much since I don't want to sound like I'm scripted by DeepSeek or something lol.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<strike>I also don't know yet if I'll use a textbook. I'll update here about it later. I like understanding grammar, so maybe I'll do that.</strike> Studying from textbooks takes too much time. I prefer to listen to or read stories, conversations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and about why I’m creating this repository, I’ve always liked the [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) method, even before I knew the term existed. I once ran an online Japanese study group where we’d post our study updates. And no, I don't actually speak Japanese if you ask me, but I'll try to get back to it someday. Sharing is a good way to hold yourself accountable while (hopefully) helping others in the process. Also, I'm too lazy/busy to create a blog (though I do want to create one in the future), and a repository is a great way to organize things in the meantime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌼 My plan is  \n",
    "- Studying every day, even for a little bit \n",
    "- Study a Little Fox episode\n",
    "- Study a Du Chinese text\n",
    "- Study the words from both apps on Immersi\n",
    "- Try to create my own sentences in different contexts (writing and speaking)\n",
    "- Use Pleco for spaced repetition\n",
    "- Only move on after \"memorizing\" at least 90% of the words I'm studying\n",
